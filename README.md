# Control-Theory
‚ùóIn the making‚ùó

This is a practical collection of 
- definitions
- theorems
- lemmas
- results
- rules
- techniques
- derivations
- proofs
and more from the field of control theory.

The note management system "Obsidian" is used for note management, and the repository contains an Obisidan Vault called "Control Theory".

The aim is to gather all the relevant (basic) theory used at the departement of Engineering Cybernetics (ITK) at NTNU, in a neat Obisidan Vault that one may copy onto ones computer and use for quick lookup of the theory one needs.
Theorems etc. links back to the relevant definitions of various terms, such that by simply hovering over the word and clicking "ctrl", one immediately sees the definition of that term in a pop-up box. 
#### **NO more fumbling back and forth in books and having five acticles open at the same time just to recap a theorem that relies in other theorems, lemmas, definitions etc. !!** 
It's all collected neatly and orderly in this vaultüôå


Definitions, theorems, etc. are organized into neat and readible bulletpoints, such that the reader may catch a glimpse of the theorem and easily get an overview of what conditions are required/assumed, and what results from the theorem. You don't need to worry about reading the theorems in text mode, and having to scrutinize the text to figure out what it says.
We also strive to use consistent notation throughout the vault to maintain readibility!
