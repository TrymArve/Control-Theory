# Control-Theory
❗In the making❗ --> Please contribute by writing about your the things you have expertise in🙌

This is a practical collection of 
- definitions
- theorems
- lemmas
- results
- rules
- techniques
- derivations
- proofs
and more from the field of control theory.

The note management system "Obsidian" is used for note management, and the repository contains an Obisidan Vault called "Control Theory".

The aim is to gather all the relevant (basic) theory used at the departement of Engineering Cybernetics (ITK) at NTNU, in a neat Obisidan Vault that one may copy onto ones computer and use for quick lookup of the theory one needs.
Theorems etc. links back to the relevant definitions of various terms, such that by simply hovering over the link, one immediately sees the definition of that term in a pop-up box. 
#### **NO more fumbling back and forth in books and having five acticles open at the same time just to recap a theorem that relies in other theorems, lemmas, definitions etc. !!** 
It's all collected neatly and orderly in this vault🙌


Definitions, theorems, etc. are organized into neat and readible bulletpoints, such that the reader may catch a glimpse of the theorem and easily get an overview of what conditions are required/assumed, and what results from the theorem. You don't need to worry about reading the theorems in text mode, and having to scrutinize the text to figure out what it says.
We also strive to use consistent notation throughout the vault to maintain readibility!

Feel free to contribute to the vault, with your own knowledge.

**Things to add:**
- some sorf of neat system for references will be concoted in the future
- suggestions?

**How to contribute:**
- Please pull the repository and add notes, then push and create pull request. (I or someone trusted will have to approve the changes)
  - I guess you should contact me first... so we can have a look at the best way to do this.
  - (we'll have to figure out how to do this properly)
  - Please adhere to the notational standards (you may suggest changing the standard)
- Reviewing notes:
  - plese take the time to review (double check) the notes created by others if you have sufficient/expertise in the field, and/or access to the reference (to cross check)
  - If you have reviewd a note, add your name to the "Review By"-tag/property of the metadata (at the top of the note).
    - This way, people who use the vault may be confident that the note does not contain many mistakes, if the notes has been reviewed by many people.
  - Please review even if many has already reviewed it. There are always more mistakes!
