# Control-Theory
This is a practical collection of 
- definitions
- theorems
- lemmas
- results
- rules
- techniques
- derivations
- proofs
and more from the field of control theory.

The note management system "Obsidian" is used for note management, and the repository contains an Obisidan Vault called "Control Theory".

The aim is to gather all relevant theory in a neat Obisidan Vault that one may copy onto ones computer, and use for quick lookup of the theory one needs.
Theorems etc. links back to the relevant definitions of various terms, such that by simply hovering over the word and clicking "ctrl", one immediately sees the definition of that term in a popup box.
