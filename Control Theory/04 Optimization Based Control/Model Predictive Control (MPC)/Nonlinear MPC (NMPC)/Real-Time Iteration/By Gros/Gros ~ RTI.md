**Inputs:**
- $(\tilde{x}^{i-1*},\tilde{u}^{i-1*})$ - the previous NMPC-NLP solution (or estimate thereof)
- $(x^{ref,i},u^{ref,i})$ - reference trajectory on current horizon
- $\hat{x}_{i}$ - current state estimate, provided in the middle of the algorithm, to ensure the most up to date estimate possible.


**Remarks:**
- The delay introduced by feedback *(from receiving new estimate to the respective control is applied)* can be accommodated by introducing a corresponding prediction of the state estimate.
- the sampling time $\Delta t_{i} = t_{i+1}-t_{i}$ is limited by the sum of the time spent in the 'preparation' and 'feedback' phases.
- The time spend in the 'feedback' phase is practically the same as the time it takes to solve the [[Gros ~ LMPC|LMPC]] problem
- The preparation of step 5) that does not require knowledge of the initial state (the parameter), can be moved to the 'preparation' phase:
	- f.ex. the "[[Condensing]]" of the problem can be done prior to knowing the state
- The increase in sampling time, $\Delta t$, required to perform the RTI scheme, from that of [[Gros ~ LMPC|Linear MPC]], is only determined by the preparation phase
- It is desirable to minimize the 'feedback time'
	- that is, move as much as possible from the feedback phase to the preparation phase
	- Because the preparation phase can often fit in the time after the previous feedback phase and before the next state estimate is available, RTI-NMPC can in many cases be applied at the same sampling frequency as that of Linear MPC based on a model that is pre-linearized off-line.
