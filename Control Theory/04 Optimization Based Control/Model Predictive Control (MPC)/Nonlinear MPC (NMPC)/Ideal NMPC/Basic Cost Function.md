$$J(\,\cdot~;u^{k}) \triangleq \sum\limits_{j =0}^{N-1} L(\tilde{x}^{k}_{j},\tilde{u}^{k}_{j}) + T(\tilde{x}^{k}_{N})$$
^cost

where the trajectory $\{x^{k}_{0}, x^{k}_{1}, \cdots , x^{k}_{N}\}$ is some is clear from context. 
Typically via the associated system dynamics and an initial state $x^{k}_{0} = \hat{x}_{k}$.
