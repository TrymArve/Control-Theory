**Definition:**
The *decision space* of an optimization problem ([[NLP formulation|NLP]]/[[QP formulation|QP]]/[[LP formulation|LP]]), is the set of which the decision/optimization variables are elements.

**Remarks:**
- Typically, the decision space is denoted as the of reals; $z \in \mathbb{R}^{n_{z}}$, and constraints are further imposed on that space in the formulation of the problem.
