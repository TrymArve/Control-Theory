Consider ![[NLP formulation#^NLP]]
The Feasible Set of (NLP) is defined as:
$$\mathbb{F}\triangleq \{z\in \mathbb{R}^{n_{z}} | \quad g(z) = 0 ~ \wedge ~h(z) \geq 0 \}$$
**Infeasible:**
- A problem is said to be **Infeasible** iff:
$$\mathbb{F} = \emptyset$$



**Remarks:**
- A point $z$ is called a *"feasible point"* if $z\in \mathbb{F}$
