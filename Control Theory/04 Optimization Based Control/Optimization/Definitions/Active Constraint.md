Consider ![[NLP formulation#^NLP]]
For a given point $z\in \mathbb{R}^{n_{z}}$ of the decision space, we say that a constraint, $g_{i}$ or $h_{i}$, is ***active*** iff:
- $g_{i}(z) = 0$  /  $h_{i}(z) = 0$


**Remarks:**
- This is a property defined *at a point* $z$ !
- All equality constraints; $g_{i}~\forall i$, are active at a solution $z^*$
	- In fact, at eq. constraints are active at any [[Feasible Set|feasible point]]; $z\in \mathbb{F}$
