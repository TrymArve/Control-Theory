Consider ![[NLP formulation#^NLP]]
The Linear Independence Constraint Qualification (LICQ) *holds at point $z$* iff:
- the gradients of all [[Active Constraint|active constraints]], $g_{i}$ and $h_{i}$, are linearly independent

**That is;**
Iff: $$\centernot\exists (\lambda,\mu):\quad \frac{\partial  g}{\partial z}\bigg|_{z'}\lambda + \frac{\partial  h}{\partial z}\bigg|_{z'}\mu = 0$$Then:
- LICQ holds at $z'$
