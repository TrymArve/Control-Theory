Consider:
![[Parametric NLP#^PNLP]]

If:
- the [[KKT-Matrix]] is full rank at $p_{0}$

Then:
- in a neighborhood of $p_{0}$, the parametric solution $z(p)$ is:
	- well defined
	- $\mathcal{C}^{1}$ 

**Remarks:**
- This results from the [[Implicit Function Theorem]]
- The KKT matrix has full rank if [[LICQ - Linear Independence Constraint Qualification|LICQ]] and [[Second Order Sufficient Condition (SOSC)|SOSC]] holds
