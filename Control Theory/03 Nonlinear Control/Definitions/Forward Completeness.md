The system ![[Consider - NTV#^system]]
is said to be **forward complete** iff
- the solutions $t\mapsto x$ exist for all $t\geq t_\circ\geq 0$

Furthermore, it is said to be **uniformly forward complete** iff
- $\exists ~ \sigma_1,\sigma_2 \in \mathcal{K}$
- $\exists~c>0$
such that
$$ |x(t,t_\circ,x_\circ)| \leq \sigma_1(t-t_\circ) + \sigma_2(|x_\circ|) + c \quad \forall t\geq t_\circ$$
