Consider:
![[Consider - NTV#^system]]

If :
- $x = 0$ is [[Lyapunov Stability|(uniformly) (globally) stable]]
- $x = 0$ is [[Attractivity|(uniformly) (globally) attractive]] in $\mathbb{D}\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n_{x}}$

Then:
- $x = 0$ is [[Lyapunov Stability|(uniformly) (globally) asymptotically stable]] in $\mathbb{D}$
