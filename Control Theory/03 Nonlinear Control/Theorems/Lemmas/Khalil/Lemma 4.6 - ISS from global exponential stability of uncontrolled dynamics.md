Consider: ![[Consider - Controlled NTV#^system]]
If:
- $f$ is 
	- in $(x,u)$ and uniformly in t
		- continuously differentiable
		- [[Lipschitz#Globally Lipschitz|globally Lipschitz]]
- the unforced/uncontrolled dynamics $\dot{x}=f(t,x,0)$
	- has an [[Lyapunov Stability#Exponential Stability (ES)|globally exponentially stable]] (GES) equilibrium at the origin $x=0$ ([[0-GAS|0-GES]])
then
- $\Sigma_\circ$ is [[ISS - Input-to-State Stability|Input-to-State Stable]] (ISS)
