Consider: ![[Consider - Feedback Interconnection#^feedback-interconnected-system]]

Let 
- [[Assumption 11 - Existence on finite time interval]]
- [[Assumption 12 - Finite time boundedness of x1]]
hold.
Then
- The solutions are defined for all $t\geq t_\circ$.  (i.e. the system is [[Forward Completeness|forward complete]])
*More precisely:*
- Condition (1) of [[Assumption 11 - Existence on finite time interval|Ass. 11]] hold with $t_{max} = +\infty$   *(arbitrarily large $t_{max}$)*
