If
- $(t,x(t)) \mapsto V(t,x(t))$
is such that
- $V$ is lower bounded
- $\dot{V} \leq 0$
- $\ddot{V}$ is uniformly bounded
then [[Barbalat's Lemma]] gives us
- $t\rightarrow\infty \implies \dot{V}\rightarrow0$


**Note:** $\exists~c:|\ddot{V}|\leq c \quad \forall~t\geq t_\circ \implies \ddot{V}$ is uniformly bounded
(from [[Uniform Boundedness]])
