%% #Theory/Definition %%
A map $f:\mathbb{D}\mapsto \mathbb{O}$ is said to be ***bijective*** iff:
- it is [[Injective]]
- it is [[Surjective]]


**Intuition:**
- Each element of $\mathbb{O}$ is mapped to, by $f$, from exactly one or no elements of $\mathbb{D}$.
- Every point in $\mathbb{O}$ has a point in $\mathbb{D}$ that maps to it.
	- The result is that all of $\mathbb{D}$ is mapped onto all of $\mathbb{O}$, uniquely.

**Remarks:**
- If a map is bijective, it is called a bijection
- If there exists a bijection between to sets, then the two sets have the same number of elements *(cardinality)*
- A bijection is invertible
	- In fact, a function is invertible *if, and only if*, it is bijective.
