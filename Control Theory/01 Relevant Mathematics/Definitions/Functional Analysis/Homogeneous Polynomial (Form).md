**Definition:**
A *homogeneous polynomial* (a.k.a. *form*) is a polynomial where all non-zero terms are of the same degree.


**Examples:**
- For example, an $n$-dimensional polynomial; $p: \mathbb{R}^{n}\mapsto \mathbb{R}$, is homogeneous if every term is of the form
$$\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{\psi_{i}}$$
	such that 
$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \psi_{i} = d$$
	where $d$ is the degree of the polynomial.
- F.ex:
$$p(x) = x_{1}^{6} + x_{1}^{5}x_{2}^{1} + x_{1}^{2}x_{2}^{4} + x_{2}^{6}$$
	is a homogeneous polynomial / form of degree $d=6$.
