**Definition:**
A [[Function|function]]; $$f:\mathbb{X}_{1}\times \mathbb{X}_{2} \times \cdots \times\mathbb{X}_{n} \mapsto \mathbb{Y}$$ is an *n-ary operation*


**Remarks:**
- Operation is the same as a function...
- An *operation* is NOT the same as an *operator*...
- An "operator" is the symbol used to denote the result of the operation, or may refer to the process/machinery that computes the result of the operation.
- The number of operands (n) is the "arity" of the operation.
