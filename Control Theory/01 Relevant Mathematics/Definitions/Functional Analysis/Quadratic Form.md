**Definition:**
A *quadratic form* is a [[Homogeneous Polynomial (Form)|form]] of degree 2.

**Remarks:*
- A [[Homogeneous Polynomial (Form)|form]] is also called a "homogeneous polynomial"
- Quadratic forms can be expressed by **square, symmetric** matrices:
$$p(x) = x^{\top}Mx = x^{\top}\begin{bmatrix}m_{11} & \frac{1}{2}m_{12} \\ \frac{1}{2}m_{12} & m_{22} \end{bmatrix}x = m_{11}x_{1}^{2} + m_{12}x_{1}x_{2} + m_{22}x_{2}^{2}$$
- Note also that square, non-symmetric matrices can produce the same polynomial $p(x)$, but it is standard to only consider the unique symmetric matrix to represent $p$.
