**Definition:**
A *binary operation* on a set, is an [[Internal Operation|internal operation]] on that set, with arity 2.


**Remarks:**
- This implies that a binary operation on $\mathbb{S}$, is a function; $$f:\mathbb{S}^{2}\mapsto \mathbb{S}$$
- A binary operation is a 2-ary internal operation that is defined on a set.
	- Thus, '*addition* on $\mathbb{R}$' is a different binary operation than '*addition* on $\mathbb{N}$'
