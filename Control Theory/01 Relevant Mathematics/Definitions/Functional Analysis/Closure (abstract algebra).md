A [[Set|set]] $\mathbb{S}$ is said to be *closed* under an [[Operation]] on $\mathbb{S}^{n}$, iff the result of that operation is in $\mathbb{S}$.

**Remarks:**
- The "close property" is inherently a property of a pair of a set $\mathbb{S}$, and a function $f$
- Consider a function $f:\mathbb{S}^{n} \mapsto \mathbb{S}$, then the pair $(\mathbb{S},f)$ has the "closure property".
	- Alternatively, we say that "$\mathbb{S}$ is *closed* under $f$"
