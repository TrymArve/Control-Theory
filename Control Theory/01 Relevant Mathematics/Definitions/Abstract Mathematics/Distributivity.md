A [[Binary Operation|binary operation]]; $\circ$, on a set $\mathbb{S}$, is *distributive* with respect to another binary operation; $\oplus$ (on the same set), iff
- $a \circ (b \oplus c) = (a\circ b) \oplus (a\circ c) \quad \forall a,b,c \in \mathbb{S}$  *(left distributivity)*
- $(a \oplus b) \circ c = (a\circ b) \oplus (a\circ c) \quad \forall a,b,c \in \mathbb{S}$  *(right distributivity)*
