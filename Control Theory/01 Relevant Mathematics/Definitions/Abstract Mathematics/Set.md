A set is a 'collection' of (mathematical) 'objects'.
- *set* - the collection itself
- *elements* - the objects contained in the set are called elements of the set



Examples of types of elements are:
- Numbers: 1, 2, $\frac{1}{5}$, $\pi$, $\sqrt{2}$, ...
- Functions: $f(x) = x^{2}$, $f(x) = \sin (x\omega)$ , $f(x,y) = \frac{x}{y+x}$, ...
- Colors: blue, green, white, ...
- Shapes: circle, square, rectangle, cylinder, tetrahedron, hypercube, ...
- Operators: +, -, * , / , ...
- Sets: $\{1,3,5\}$,     $\{x^{2}, y+x, 5\}$,     $\{5 , \{x^{2},blue\}, cube \}$


**Remarks:**
- Two sets are equal if they contain the same elements.
	- That implies the number of copies of an element as well
	- f.ex:  {3,4,5} = {5,3,4}, but {3,4,5} $\centernot=$ {3,3,4,5}
- A set with one element is called a
	- "singleton"
	- "unit set"
- The elements of a set has no order, thus the order in which they are written using the "roster/enumeration notation"({ , , }) is not relevant.
	- Some ordered structures include
		- "sequence"
		- "tuple"
		- "permutation" of a set
