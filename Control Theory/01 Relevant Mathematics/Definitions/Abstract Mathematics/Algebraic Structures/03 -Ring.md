**Definition:**
The ordered triple $(\mathbb{S},\oplus,\circ)$, consisting of 
- a set $\mathbb{S} \centernot= \emptyset$
- two [[Binary Operation|binary operations]] $\oplus$ and $\circ$

is a *ring*, iff:
- $(\mathbb{S},\oplus)$ is a [[02 Commutative Group (Abelian Group)|commutative group]]
- $(\mathbb{S},\circ)$ is a [[02 Monoid|monoid]]
- $\circ$ is [[Distributivity|distributive]] with respect to $\oplus$


**Remarks:**
- Do not confuse a *ring* with a *rng*, which is similar, but does not need a multiplicative ($\circ$) identity.
- The integers, $\mathbb{Z}$, under normal addition and multiplication; $(\mathbb{Z},+,\cdot)$, is a ring
