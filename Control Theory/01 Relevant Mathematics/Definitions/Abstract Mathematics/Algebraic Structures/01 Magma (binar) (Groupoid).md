A *magma* is an ordered pair $(\mathbb{S},\oplus)$ consisting of
- a set $\mathbb{S} \centernot= \emptyset$
- and a [[Binary Operation|binary operation]]; $\oplus$, on $\mathbb{S}$


**Remarks:**
- Since a [[Binary Operation|binary operation]] is defined on a set, simply creating an ordered pair consisting of that set and the binary operation will result in a magma.
	- For instance, *addition(+)* on $\mathbb{R}$ is a binary operation, thus $(\mathbb{R},+)$ is a magma.
	- Also, *addition* on $\mathbb{N}$ is another binary operation, thus $(\mathbb{N},+)$ is a different magma.'
- A magma is perhaps the most basic [[00 Algebraic Structure]]
- Since a [[Binary Operation|binary operation]], by definition, closes the set it is defined on, the set contained in a magma is always closed under the respective binary operation.
