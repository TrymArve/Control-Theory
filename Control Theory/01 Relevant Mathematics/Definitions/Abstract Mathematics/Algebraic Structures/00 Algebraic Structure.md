An *Algebraic Structure* consists of:
- $\mathbb{S} \centernot= \emptyset$  (a non-empty set)
- A collection of operations on $\mathbb{S}$   (f.ex. addition, multiplication)
- A (finite) set of identities/axioms that the operations must satisfy


**Examples:**
- Group
	- Commutative Group / Abelian Group
- Ring
	- Commutative Ring
- Field
- Lattice
- Module
- Algebra
