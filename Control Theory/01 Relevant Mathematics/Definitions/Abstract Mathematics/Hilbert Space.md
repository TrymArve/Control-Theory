A *Hilbert space* is an [[06 - Inner Product Space|inner product space]]; $(\mathbb{F},\oplus,\circ,\mathbb{V},+,\cdot,\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle)$, such that
- $(\mathbb{V},d(\cdot,\cdot))$ is a [[Complete Metric Space|complete metric space]]
	- where; $$d(x,y)\triangleq \sqrt{\langle x-y,x-y \rangle}$$
	- (where $-$ is the vector additive ($+$) inverse)


**Remarks:**
- The metric $d(x,y)$ is simply the norm of the difference between $x$ and $y$; $$d(x,y) = ||x-y||$$
	- (the norm that is 'induced' by the inner product)
