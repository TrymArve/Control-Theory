A map $f:\mathbb{D}\mapsto \mathbb{O}$ is said to be ***surjective*** iff:
- $\exists a \in \mathbb{D}: b=f(a)\quad \forall b\in \mathbb{O}$



**Intuition:**
- Every point in $\mathbb{O}$ has a point in $\mathbb{D}$ that maps to it.
OR:  
- $\mathbb{O} = \{b~~|~~b=f(a)~~\forall a\in \mathbb{D}\}$

**Remarks:**
- A surjective map is called a surjection
- Note that $\mathbb{O}$ is the codomain, and not the image of $f$.
	- F.ex: 
		- $\mathbb{R}\mapsto \mathbb{R}:x\mapsto e^{x}$ is not surjective, since not all of $\mathbb{R}$ can be mapped to by $e^{x}$
		- $\mathbb{R}\mapsto \mathbb{R}_{>0}:x\mapsto e^{x}$ *is* surjective, however, since all of $\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ can be mapped to by $e^{x}$
- If the image of a function is equal to its codomain, then the function is a surjection.
	- i.e. a map is always a surjection onto its own image
