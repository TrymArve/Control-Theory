The Initial Value Problem (IVP) is a special case of the [[Boundary Value Problem (BVP)]], consisting of finding solutions $$y:\mathbb{R}\mapsto \mathbb{R}^{n_{y}}$$of a differential equation; $$f\left(y(t),\frac{\partial y(t)}{\partial t},t\right) \equiv 0$$subject to a single [[Boundary Value Problem (BVP)|Dirichlet Constraint]] constraints; the *"Initial Value"*: $$y(t_{\circ}) = y_{\circ}$$
