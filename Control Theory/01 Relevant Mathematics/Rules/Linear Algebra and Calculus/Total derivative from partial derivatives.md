Consider
$$f:\mathbb{D}_{1}\times \mathbb{D}_{2} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{D}_{n} \mapsto \mathbb{O}$$
such that
$$(x,y_{1},\cdots,y_{n-1}) \mapsto z$$
Then the [[Derivative (Total)|total derivative]] of $f$ w.r.t. $x$ can be computed as
$$\frac{df}{dx} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{\partial f}{\partial y_{i}}\frac{dy_{i}}{dx}$$
