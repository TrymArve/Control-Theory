#Theory/Remark
A function that is [[Lipschitz#(Globally) Lipschitz|(globally) Lipschitz]], has a constant L such that any compact set on the domain, the derivative is bounded by L.
We remark that a function with its derivative bounded by a constant L, can still be unbounded.
- Take $f(x) = x$
	- this function is Lipschitz, since its derivative is $f'(x)=1<L~ \forall x$.
	- however the function is unbounded, since its range is an unbounded set: $\mathbb{R}$.
