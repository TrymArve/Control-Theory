# Notation
In this vault, we strive to be consistent in our notation in order to
- maintain readability;
	- it easier to read through the theory quickly when you can tell by the notation what is meant by the various symbols
	- it is easier to compare notes when they use the same notation;
		- when looking at a theorem that utilizes a term/concept, you might want to look quickly at the definition of that term/concept. In such a case, it is convenient that the notation is the same in the theorem and definition.
- streamline communication between coworkers;
	- it is convenient to use the same notation when
		- discussing theory with another person
		- collaborating on/writing in the same note


## Symbols
We would like to align everyone's use of symbols within this vault, so as to maintain notational consistency. Here is a list of symbols and their respective meaning, that we will strive to adhere to. That is, we always use the relevant symbol for the given meaning, rather than another symbol, and the symbol should never be used to mean something else.
