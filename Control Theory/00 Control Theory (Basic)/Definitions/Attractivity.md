#Theory/Definition
**Attractivity** in $\mathbb{D}\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is obtained iff
- $\forall t_0$
	- $\forall \sigma > 0$
		- $\exists~T>0$
		- such that
$$ x(t_0) \in \mathbb{D} \implies (~||x(t)|| \leq \sigma \quad \forall t\geq t_0+T~)$$

- **Globality:** Global Attractivity (GA) is obtained iff $\mathbb{D}=\mathbb{R}$

- **Uniformity:** Uniform Attractivity (UA) is achieved iff the conditions hold independently of $t_0$. That is, without the "$\forall t_0$" at the beginning.
