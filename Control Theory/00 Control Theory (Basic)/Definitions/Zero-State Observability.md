#Theory/Definition/Zero-State-Observability

Consider: ![[Consider - Controlled NTI#^system]]
where 
- $f$ is locally Lipschitz
- h is continuous
- $f(0,0)=0$
- $h(0,0) = 0$


Iff 
- no solution of $\Sigma_\circ$ with $u\equiv0$ can stay identically in 
	- $\mathbb{S} = \{x\in\mathbb{R}^{n_x}|h(x,0)=0\}$
	other than the trivial solution $x(t)\equiv0$
then 
- the system is **zero-state observable**
