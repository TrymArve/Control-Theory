Consider: ![[Consider - NTI#^system]]
Iff:
- the solutions of $\Sigma_\circ$ are [[Forward Completeness|forward complete]]
- $\exists~\alpha\in\mathcal{K},\gamma\in\mathcal{K}_\infty:$
	$$ \int_{t_\circ}^{\infty} \alpha(||x(t)||) ~dt \leq \gamma(||x_\circ||) $$
then
- the origin is [[Lyapunov Stability#Asymptotic Stability (AS)|globally asymptotically stable]] (GAS)
