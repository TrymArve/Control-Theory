Consider: ![[Consider - Cascade Interconnection (Time-Invariant)#^cascade-interconnected-system]]
If:
- the origin of $\Sigma_2$ is GAS
- the origin of $\Sigma_1$ is 0-GAS w.r.t. input $x_2$
- the solutions of $\Sigma_1$ remain bounded as $x_2\rightarrow0$
then:
- the origin of the cascaded interconnection $\Sigma_1+\Sigma_2$ is [[Lyapunov Stability#Asymptotic Stability (AS)|GAS]].
